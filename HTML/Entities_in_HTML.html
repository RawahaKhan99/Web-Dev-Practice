    <p>HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML or are not easily typed on a keyboard. These entities are used to ensure that the characters are displayed correctly in the browser without being interpreted as HTML code. They begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).</p>

            <ol>Encoding Non-ASCII Characters: Ensures that characters from various languages are displayed correctly on all browsers.</ol>
