# Web Development Practice Projects

This repository contains my learning projects as I explore web development.

Each folder includes experiments or exercises related to topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frontend libraries.

> ⚠️ These are not production-ready projects. They're meant for practice, experiments, and personal growth.
